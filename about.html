    <p>I am a developer from Ankara, Turkey.</p>
    <p>
        I currently work full time for a major publishing house in Turkey.
        My main focus of development at work is on an online academic journal database
        which consumes much of my time dedicated to development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently I've taken up the motivation to humbly contribute to the development
        community to whom I owe almost all of my skills and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not by far a guru nor would I classify myself as an influencing type, but
        I made up my mind to share what I stumble upon every now and then.

        I spend most of my workday with Laravel. I recently started replacing the jQuery
        in my project with vuejs for my sanity, so I use that heavily as well. The stack
        and points of interests I deal with almost everyday include (but not limited to):
        <ul>
            <li>Laravel</li>
            <li>MySQL &amp; MariaDB</li>
            <li>Vue.js</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>Elasticsearch</li>
            <li>WordML &amp; IDML</li>
            <li>PHPUnit</li>
            <li>Selenium</li>
            <li>Gulp tasking</li>
            <li>Deployment</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        What I see most during my day is Vim, iTerm2 and Navicat.
        An occasional PHPStorm interface every few days in a month as well.
    </p>
    <p>Oh well, and the Stackoverflow and GitHub logos...</p>
